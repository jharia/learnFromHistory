learnFromHistory
================

A Chrome extension for learning from the internet rabbit hole

WIP, so what it can do:
- Give you a list of recent wikipedia articles, and allow you to revisit them

What it will be able to do soon: 
- Give you a pretty graph of recent wikipedia articles showing how you got there
- Integrate data from other sources
